 * Tests for the SudokuImageService.
 * 
 * Note: Testing the SudokuImageService is challenging because it relies on:
 * 1. System clipboard access
 * 2. OpenCV native libraries
 * 3. Tesseract OCR
 * 
 * These dependencies make it difficult to create proper unit tests without
 * extensive mocking. In a real-world scenario, this would be better tested
 * with integration tests that have the actual dependencies available.

     * In a real-world scenario, we would create integration tests that:
     * 1. Set up a known image in the clipboard
     * 2. Call the service to extract the board
     * 3. Verify the extracted board matches the expected board
     * 
     * However, this requires:
     * - A properly configured environment with OpenCV and Tesseract
     * - The ability to manipulate the system clipboard
     * - Test images with known Sudoku boards
     * 
     * For now, we'll just document the testing approach.
