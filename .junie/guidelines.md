## Project Structure

The Sudoku Solver follows a standard Spring Boot application structure:

```
sudoku-solver/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/
│   │   │       └── sudokusolver/
│   │   │           ├── controller/    # REST API controllers
│   │   │           ├── model/         # Data models
│   │   │           ├── service/       # Business logic
│   │   │           ├── repository/    # Data access (if applicable)
│   │   │           ├── exception/     # Custom exceptions
│   │   │           ├── util/          # Utility classes
│   │   │           └── SudokuSolverApplication.java  # Main class
│   │   └── resources/
│   │       ├── static/                # Frontend assets (JS, CSS, images)
│   │       ├── templates/             # HTML templates (if using a template engine)
│   │       └── application.properties # Application configuration
│   └── test/
│       └── java/                      # Test classes mirroring the main structure
├── pom.xml                            # Maven configuration
└── README.md                          # Project documentation
```

When adding new features:
- Place new components in the appropriate package based on their responsibility
- Maintain separation of concerns between layers (controller, service, model)
- Frontend code should be organized in the static resources directory

## Coding Standards

### Java Code

- Follow standard Java naming conventions:
    - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `SudokuSolver`)
    - Methods and variables: camelCase (e.g., `solveBoard()`)
    - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_BOARD_SIZE`)
- Use meaningful names that describe the purpose of the entity
- Keep methods focused on a single responsibility
- Limit method length to improve readability (aim for < 30 lines)
- Use appropriate access modifiers (private, protected, public)
- Include JavaDoc comments for public methods and classes
- Use final for immutable variables and parameters where appropriate
- Handle exceptions properly with specific catch blocks
- Use Java 21 features where they improve code readability

### Frontend Code

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes
- Keep JavaScript functions small and focused
- Use ES6+ features where browser support allows
- Separate concerns: HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JS for behavior
- Ensure responsive design for all UI components

## Testing Requirements

All new features must include appropriate tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
    - Controllers
    - Services
    - Utility classes
    - Models (where applicable)

- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
    - API endpoints
    - Service-to-service interactions

- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows (optional for smaller features)

Testing guidelines:
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage for new code
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Documentation Requirements

For each new feature:

1. **Code Documentation**:
    - Add JavaDoc comments to all public classes and methods
    - Include inline comments for complex logic

2. **README Updates**:
    - Update the README.md if the feature changes the application's functionality, setup, or usage

3. **API Documentation**:
    - Document new API endpoints with:
        - URL
        - HTTP method
        - Request parameters/body
        - Response format
        - Error responses
        - Example requests and responses

4. **User Documentation** (if applicable):
    - Update user-facing documentation for UI changes

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Planning**:
    - Create a detailed specification for the feature
    - Break down the feature into smaller tasks
    - Identify potential challenges and dependencies

2. **Implementation**:
    - Create a feature branch from the main branch
    - Implement the feature according to the specification
    - Follow the coding standards
    - Write tests as you develop

3. **Testing**:
    - Ensure all tests pass
    - Perform manual testing
    - Address any issues found during testing

4. **Documentation**:
    - Update documentation as specified in the Documentation Requirements

5. **Code Review**:
    - Submit a pull request
    - Address feedback from code review

6. **Merge**:
    - Merge the feature branch into the main branch after approval

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a pull request with a descriptive title and detailed description
2. Link the pull request to any relevant issues
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request reviews from appropriate team members
5. Address all review comments
6. Squash commits if necessary for a clean history
7. Merge only after receiving approval from at least one reviewer

## Performance Considerations

- Consider the time complexity of algorithms, especially for the Sudoku solving logic
- Minimize database queries and optimize when necessary
- Use caching where appropriate
- Consider pagination for endpoints that return large datasets
- Optimize frontend assets (minify JS/CSS, optimize images)
- Use lazy loading for components that aren't immediately visible
- Profile and benchmark performance-critical code

## Security Guidelines

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before displaying it to prevent XSS attacks
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement appropriate authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities
- Don't expose sensitive information in logs or error messages
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Ensure all UI elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide appropriate alt text for images
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Support screen readers with ARIA attributes where necessary
- Test with accessibility tools (e.g., Lighthouse, WAVE)
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Versioning

The project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version for backward-compatible bug fixes

When implementing features:
- Determine whether the feature constitutes a MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH change
- Update version numbers in appropriate files
- Document changes in a CHANGELOG.md file

These guidelines are meant to evolve over time. If you have suggestions for improvements, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
